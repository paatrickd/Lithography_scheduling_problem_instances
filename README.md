# Lithography_scheduling_problem_instances

This repository contains problem instances for the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem, including machine and sequence dependent setup times, eligibility constraints, two auxiliary resources per job (a pod and a reticle) and trasnfer times for the auxiliary resources.

The problem instances found hereare used in two different papers.

1. *Scheduling a Real-World Photolithography Area with Constraint Programming* by *Patrick Deenen, Wim Nuijten and Alp Akcay*. The problem instances used in this paper can be found in:
- **10 real-world problem instances**
- **small problem instances**

2. *Optimizing production control in the photolithography area of a semiconductor manufacturing facility* by *Patrick Deenen, Rick Adriaensen, Alp Akcay, Wim Nuijten and Ivo Adan*. The problem instances used in this paper can be found in **5 real-world problem instances**.
- **5 real-world problem instances**

Further explanation on the problem instances can be found on on: https://github.com/paatrickd/Lithography_scheduling_problem_instances/wiki/Explanation-on-problem-instances.
