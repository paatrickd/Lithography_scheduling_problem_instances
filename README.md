# Lithography_scheduling_problem_instances

This repository contains problem instances for the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem, including machine and sequence dependent setup times, eligibility constraints, two auxiliary resources per job (a pod and a reticle) and trasnfer times for the auxiliary resources.

Further explanation on the problem instances can be found on on: https://github.com/paatrickd/Lithography_scheduling_problem_instances/wiki/Explanation-on-problem-instances.
